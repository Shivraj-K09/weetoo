# LiveKit Management Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Database Setup and Event Logging

1. Create new tables in Supabase:

   - `livekit_sessions`: Track individual broadcasting sessions
     - id (UUID, primary key)
     - user_id (references public.users)
     - room_id (references trading_rooms)
     - started_at (timestamp)
     - ended_at (timestamp)
     - duration_seconds (integer)
     - created_at (timestamp)
   - `livekit_user_stats`: Aggregate statistics per user
     - user_id (references public.users, primary key)
     - total_duration_seconds (integer)
     - total_sessions (integer)
     - last_session_at (timestamp)
     - first_session_at (timestamp)
     - updated_at (timestamp)

2. Create database functions and triggers:
   - Function to update user stats when a session is created/updated
   - Function to calculate monthly usage statistics
   - RLS policies to restrict access to admin users only

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation

1. Create LiveKit event handlers:

   - Hook into LiveKit events (participant joined, participant left)
   - Record session start/end times
   - Calculate session durations
   - Update user statistics

2. Create API endpoints:

   - GET /api/admin/livekit/stats: Overall platform statistics
   - GET /api/admin/livekit/users: User-level statistics
   - GET /api/admin/livekit/rooms: Room-level statistics
   - GET /api/admin/livekit/history: Historical usage data

3. Implement access control:
   - Restrict access to users with 'admin' or 'super_admin' roles
   - Add middleware to verify permissions

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

1. Create admin dashboard page:

   - Create route at /admin/livekit-management
   - Implement layout and navigation

2. Implement dashboard components:

   - Usage metric cards (already implemented)
   - User usage table with sorting and filtering
   - Usage history chart with date range selection
   - Room usage breakdown

3. Add admin controls:
   - User search and filtering
   - Date range selection
   - Export functionality (CSV/Excel)
   - Cost calculation based on LiveKit pricing

## Phase 4: Cost Estimation and Reporting

1. Implement cost calculation:

   - Add LiveKit pricing parameters (configurable)
   - Calculate estimated costs based on usage
   - Project future costs based on growth trends

2. Create reporting features:
   - Monthly usage reports
   - Cost breakdown by user/room
   - Usage anomaly detection
   - Budget alerts

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

1. Testing:

   - Unit tests for backend functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - UI testing for admin dashboard

2. Deployment:
   - Database migrations
   - Backend deployment
   - Frontend deployment
   - Monitoring setup

## Phase 6: Future Enhancements

1. Advanced analytics:

   - User behavior patterns
   - Usage optimization recommendations
   - AI-powered cost forecasting

2. Additional features:
   - Usage quotas per user/room
   - Automated cost allocation
   - Integration with billing systems
   - Real-time usage monitoring

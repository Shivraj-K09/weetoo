[] When we close the trade that time it should be removed from the open position to the trade history instantly
[] also when user closes the trade it should be reflected on the virtual currnecy instantly because curently it's not reflected instantly.

[] Major issue is this when i refresh the page like the close button the virtual currency and all the data coming dyanmically like open position and trade history is and the chat the participants panel is not displaying anything and i need to close the window of that and refresh the page again and open the room and then options are displaying sometime i need to refresh the page multiple times the table page to display all those options.

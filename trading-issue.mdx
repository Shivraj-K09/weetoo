1.  Profit Rate Calculation

If a user receives $10,000 in Virtual Trading Money after opening a trading room and loses it all,
→ their profit rate is -100%.

If they open a second trading room and lose another $10,000,
→ their total profit rate becomes -200%.

If in the third trading room they grow the $10,000 into $20,000,
→ their profit rate increases by +100%, resulting in an overall profit rate of -100%.

The profit rate is cumulatively recorded and stored.
If a user uses the “Reset Trade History” item,
→ all negative profit rates will be cleared.

Issues Found

1.  No changes observed in Evaluation / Holdings / Available Balance after entry 2. After closing a trade, the P&L in the history shows 0%
2.  Opened positions are not being displayed on the chart 4. Profit rate is not increasing properly
    ⸻
    *During another round of testing, we noticed that positions couldn’t even be opened, and even when trades were made and profits were generated, the balance did not increase —
    instead, the balance kept decreasing by the amount traded each time!It seems the balance system itself is not functioning correctly!
    *Also, fees for market and limit orders should be applied differently depending on the leverage.

    Please review these points first,
    and I will continue to share additional detailed feedback regarding the trading functionalities as we proceed!

3.  We’re currently testing the trading room, but it seems that the connection is not very stable!
    In a trading system where every second counts, slow transaction processing speed is also a critical issue.
    Could you please share the current progress status with us?
    I’ll check the relevant points based on your update and provide feedback step by step!

4.  At the moment, virtual trading funds are being credited properly.  
    However, for the simulation trading system, it would be best to base the structure and standards on Binance.
    Currently, the simulation trading is not functioning properly yet.

5.  When users first enter the trading room, the window doesn’t automatically fit the UI properly — they have to manually adjust the size themselves.
    We would like to fix it so that the screen we designed appears correctly and fully by default for everyone, without needing any manual resizing, like the second image below.
    Also, regarding the white space inside the red box, it seems to be caused by the chat window being too short.
    Please help us fix this part as well. :)

6.  Currently, the section I dragged with the mouse doesn’t have a fixed position value,
    so whenever the numbers change, the position also shifts along with it.
    We would like to fix this by locking the position so that even if the numbers change, the position remains stable.

7.  We conducted virtual trading, but the system’s response speed is significantly slow.
    Since trading often involves split-second decisions, position entries and exits need to react immediately.
    Also, after setting the position size and leverage and entering a trade, the corresponding profit should accumulate in the virtual money balance.
    However, currently, only the portion used to open the position is being deducted from the virtual balance, without reflecting any profits.
    We would also like to confirm whether today's profit record and total profit record are being properly updated,
    but as of now, it seems this functionality has not yet been implemented.
    Overall, the simulation trading flow is not working as expected.
    It would be helpful if you could check the virtual trading example on our reference site,
    AntTalk Virtual Trading - BTC/USDT, to better understand the structure we are aiming for.

8.  Even though it's not a trading room that I created, I am still able to make changes.
    What I want is for participants to only be able to watch,
    while only the trader who created the room can control the screen.

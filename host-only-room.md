# Host-Only Trading Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement a system where only the host can trade, while participants can watch in real-time.

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Verify Permission Controls

- [x] Check that the `isHost` flag is correctly passed to all trading components
- [x] Ensure the TradingForm component has proper disabled states for non-hosts
- [x] Verify that the `room-page.tsx` correctly identifies the host using: `const isHost = user?.id === roomDetails?.owner_id`

### ✅ Step 2: Enhance Real-Time Updates

- [x] Add detailed toast notifications when the host opens or closes positions
- [x] Create a host activity indicator to show when the host is actively trading
- [x] Implement custom events to coordinate UI updates across components

### Step 3: Improve User Experience for Participants

- [x] Create an activity feed to show recent host trading actions
- [x] Enhance position display with better visual distinctions
- [x] Add clear indicators for host-created positions

### Step 4: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test with at least one host and multiple participants simultaneously
- [ ] Verify that all participants see the host's trades in real-time
- [ ] Test what happens when participants join mid-session
- [ ] Ensure proper behavior when the host disconnects temporarily

### Step 5: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize the real-time subscriptions to minimize bandwidth usage
- [ ] Implement batching for multiple rapid updates
- [ ] Add better loading indicators for participants waiting for data

## Notes

- No code changes are needed for the basic functionality if your permissions are already set up correctly
- The existing real-time infrastructure should handle most of the requirements
- Focus on UI clarity to ensure participants understand they are in view-only mode

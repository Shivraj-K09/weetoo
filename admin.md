For the dashboard we need,

- Kor_coin total balance
- New customers data
- Activity points total
- Using Kor_coins : HOw can we do this ? That's the big question.
  - So we need to track the usage of the kor_coins.
- New sign ups daily data needed (24 hours)
- Total registered users data needed.
- Daily UID registration.
  - Why do we need this UID ? What's the purpose of this UID?
- Trading Volume
  - How are we calculating this trading volume ? again the big question.
- So we need kor_coin acitivity: SO is it daily activity ? or how is it ?
- User sign ups

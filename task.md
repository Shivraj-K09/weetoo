# WebRTC Broadcasting Implementation Plan

## Core Implementation Tasks

### 1. Add Broadcast Fields to Database

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Update Supabase trading_rooms table to include is_broadcasting (boolean) and broadcast_started_at (timestamp) fields to track broadcast status.

### 2. Create Host Broadcasting UI

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Implement the UI components for the room owner to start/stop broadcasting and toggle camera/mic. Add this to the existing room header where the "Start Streaming" button is currently placed.

### 3. Implement Media Device Access

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Create functions to request and manage camera and microphone access. Include a preview video for the host to see themselves before going live.

### 4. Set Up Socket.io Signaling Server

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Create a Socket.io server using Next.js API routes for WebRTC signaling. Implement room-based connections where users join socket rooms based on trading room ID.

### 5. Implement Basic WebRTC for Host

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Set up WebRTC PeerConnection creation, media stream capture, and offer generation for the broadcasting side. Connect this to the Socket.io signaling.

### 6. Create Viewer UI Component

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Develop the video player component for participants to view the broadcast, including waiting state, volume controls, and fullscreen toggle.

### 7. Implement WebRTC for Viewers

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Create the viewer-side WebRTC connection handling, including answer generation and remote stream attachment to the video element.

### 8. Add Broadcast State Management

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Implement functions to update room status in Supabase when broadcast starts/stops and notify participants of status changes.

### 9. Configure STUN/TURN Servers

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Set up STUN servers for NAT traversal and TURN servers as fallback for when direct connections fail. Essential for WebRTC to work across different networks.

### 10. Implement Connection Monitoring

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Add network quality indicators and statistics collection to monitor connection health. Create reconnection logic for dropped connections.

### 11. Add Security Checks

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Implement authentication checks to ensure only room owners can broadcast. Add encryption verification for WebRTC connections.

### 12. Create Resource Cleanup Functions

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Ensure proper cleanup of media streams, peer connections, and socket connections when broadcasts end or users leave to prevent memory leaks.

### 13. Add Browser Compatibility Handling

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Implement feature detection for WebRTC support and graceful fallbacks for unsupported browsers. Test specifically with Safari.

### 14. Implement Error Handling

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Add comprehensive error handling for permission denials, connection failures, and other potential issues. Create user-friendly error messages.

### 15. Add UI Polish and Transitions

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Refine the UI with proper loading states, transitions, and visual feedback for both host and participants.

## Advanced Features (For Later Iterations)

### 16. Implement Adaptive Bitrate

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Add functionality to adjust video quality based on network conditions. Implement simulcast for better quality adaptation.

### 17. Create Scaling Solution

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Implement a solution for handling rooms with larger numbers of viewers (10+), potentially using a selective forwarding unit (SFU).

### 18. Add Recording Capability

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Implement functionality to record broadcasts for later playback. Include storage and retrieval mechanisms.

### 19. Implement Screen Sharing

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Add the ability for hosts to share their screen in addition to camera feed. Include controls to switch between camera and screen.

### 20. Create Analytics Dashboard

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Develop a dashboard for tracking broadcast metrics like viewer count, duration, and quality statistics.

## First Implementation Sprint

For your first implementation sprint, focus on these high-priority tasks:

1. Add Broadcast Fields to Database (Easy, High)
2. Create Host Broadcasting UI (Medium, High)
3. Implement Media Device Access (Medium, High)
4. Set Up Socket.io Signaling Server (Medium, High)
5. Configure STUN/TURN Servers (Medium, High)
6. Implement Basic WebRTC for Host (Hard, High)
7. Create Viewer UI Component (Medium, Medium)
8. Implement WebRTC for Viewers (Hard, High)

This gives you a complete end-to-end implementation of the core broadcasting functionality that you can then refine and enhance in subsequent sprints.

# Weetoo Platform

## Core Concept

Weetoo is a trading simulation platform where:

- Users can join rooms to learn how trading works
- All trading is simulated (not real money)
- The experience is gamified with points to make learning more engaging

## Trading Rooms

- **Free access**: Anyone can join trading rooms at no cost
- **Learning environment**: Users watch hosts demonstrate trading strategies
- **Support system**: If users find value, they can voluntarily support hosts with KOR_Coins
- **Room creation**: Any user can create a trading room by spending KOR_Coins

## Virtual Currency System

- **KOR_Coins**: The platform's virtual currency
- **Pricing**: ₩1,100 = 1,000 KOR_Coins
- **Usage**: Used for supporting hosts and purchasing items, not for actual trading
- **Earning**: Users can earn up to 5,000 KOR_Coins daily through community activities

## Simulation Trading

- Trading rooms use separate virtual points (not KOR_Coins)
- Room hosts start with $10,000 in virtual currency
- Virtual assets carry over between sessions
- If balance falls below $10,000, it resets to $10,000 for the next session

## Withdrawal System

- Users can withdraw KOR_Coins as real money
- Minimum withdrawal: 10,000 KOR_Coins
- Payout rates based on user level:
  - Level 1-40: 60% (10,000 KOR_Coins = ₩6,000)
  - Level 41-70: 70% (10,000 KOR_Coins = ₩7,000)
  - Level 71-90: 80% (10,000 KOR_Coins = ₩8,000)
  - Level 91-99: 90% (10,000 KOR_Coins = ₩9,000)
- Withdrawals processed manually via bank transfer

## Gamification Elements

- Trading rooms themselves are gamified learning environments

- Support system creates a win-win situation
- Room creators can monetize by providing valuable strategies

The platform aims to create a win-win environment where experienced traders can share insights and earn support, while new traders can learn in a risk-free environment.
